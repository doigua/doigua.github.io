									The multiple camera mode of production is a popular filmmaking and video production technique. Those cameras work together to provide us with different perspectives without requiring us to change the position or the settings of a camera frequently. In this way, multiple shots can thus be obtained in a single take without having to start and stop the action. Considering the time spent in shooting or video editing, this is much more efficient. So, I was ecstatic to be a part of it and record the memorable moment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Talking about the multicam project, it was a two-day shooting mission for a music live show in cooperation with our professors and the musicians. Our crew of multicam is consisted of the production, post-production, script supervisor, cinematographer, image director, sound director, and the role I play <code>the technical director</code>, which is charge of the devices, including their application, operation condition, and return.

									To discuss our work specifically, it started a few months ago and contains a lot of preparation work, for exemple, such as the planning and the pre-production. For the technical directors, it is a time to check the equipments. If they were in good conduction, the mode was correct, the amount was sufficient, and so on. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Next, three days before the shooting day, the technical group packaged and transformed the equipment to the theatre, installed them properly, and ensured that all of our equipment run in a right way. It was a job that required a lot of patience and carefulness, because we had to deal with hundreds of cables and device interfaces of the devices and joint them correctly. And we also received a call sheet to inform everyone, confirm each of us kwon his role, and the schedule of the filming day.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then came the big day for filming. Everyone was in their proper place, thoroughly tested again every equipment work well, like the light, the sound, the camera, the walkie talkie, the filming management, the memory cart,....and of cause the instrument. Later, a smoke maker began to work, the cameraman adjusted the parameters of the camera and the lights principle were turned off. Eventually, the camera were turned on, and the show actioned.

								<p>
									When all the filming part was completed, the work did not. The technical director must return the equipments in the condition as they were received. And our project entered the post production part.
								</p>
								<p>
									To sum up, it was a unique and special journey for me, and I was appreciate for the opportunity. I obtained so many assistance from my classmates who have extensive professional experience. Careful observation and meticulous recording allowed me to gain a wealth of practical knowledge, and we truly achieved a combination of theory and practice. Through practice, our theories are validated, our mistakes are corrected, our operations become unforgettable. I think, these are the meaning of practice.
